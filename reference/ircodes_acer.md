These are good for some acer projectors. I have never seen these online so far, despite searching for a couple of hours...
So I've ordered one of these remotes and recorded them for anyone to use. :)

You can use these with some of those smart IR Repeaters, or with esphome and whatever IR LED you can find. 
I have a project for that: https://github.com/staernid/esphome_projects
